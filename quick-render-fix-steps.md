# Quick Render Fix - 3 Simple Steps

## The Problem
Your Render deployment is timing out because it's trying to build the frontend (which takes 8+ seconds and creates 1.3MB of files) when it should only build the backend API.

## The Solution (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Update Render Build Command
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your godivatech service
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Find **Build Command** field
5. Change from:
   ```
   npm install; npm run build
   ```
   To:
   ```
   npm install; esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Start Command
Make sure **Start Command** is:
```
node dist/index.js
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Click **Manual Deploy**
2. Wait for deployment (should be much faster now)
3. Test your API: https://godivatech-backend.onrender.com/api/health

## Expected Results

### Before (Current Issue):
- Build time: 8+ seconds
- Output size: 1.3MB+ 
- Deployment: Times out after 15+ minutes
- Status: ❌ Failed

### After (Fixed):
- Build time: ~8ms  
- Output size: ~137KB
- Deployment: 1-2 minutes
- Status: ✅ Success

## Why This Works

**Current Problem**: Render is building both frontend AND backend
**Solution**: Render should only build backend (API server)
**Result**: 100x faster build, no timeout

## Architecture Reminder
- **Vercel**: Hosts your frontend (godivatech.com)
- **Render**: Hosts your backend API (godivatech-backend.onrender.com)

This separation is correct and will solve your timeout issue immediately.
